# Create a barebones, responsive website foundation with the following requirements:

## Structure
Semantic HTML only (header, main, section, footer).


## Components:
A header with site name/logo and simple nav.
A hero section with a heading, subheading, and a call-to-action button.
Basic typography styles for headings, paragraphs, and links.
A footer with copyright and minimal links.

## Styling
Use pure, hand-written CSS only.
Do not use Tailwind, Bootstrap, shadcn, or any other CSS/UI frameworks or libraries.
Follow modern CSS best practices:
CSS variables (:root { --variable }) for colors, fonts, and spacing.
Fluid typography with clamp().
Media queries with a mobile-first approach.
Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.
Logical properties (e.g., margin-inline, padding-block) for better internationalization.
aspect-ratio for consistent media sizing.
Smooth transitions for hover states.
Modern units like svh/lvh for stable viewport sizing.
Dark/light mode support using prefers-color-scheme.
Include a minimal reset (* { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; }).
Add accessible focus and hover states with clear contrast.

## JavaScript
Use vanilla JavaScript only.
Do not use React, Vue, Angular, or any frontend frameworks/libraries.
Keep it minimal (e.g., toggle mobile navigation menu).
