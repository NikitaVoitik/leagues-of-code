A personalized journey for every student
The Leagues
Our program is organized in 5 Leagues. Once per 20 classes students take the exam in order to try to advance to the next League. Students start in the League that matches their current ability.

Placement
Each student is initially assigned to the League they choose. During the first class instructor will decide whether this League is suitable for this particular student or not, and if not, assign them to a different League. As a result, students are always placed in a group with peers at the same level and progress naturally.

League 1
League 1 provides an ongoing learning journey, allowing for continuous growth and refinement in competitive programming skills without a defined end.

The Leagues structure

League 5

League 4
Learn the basics of programming, fundamental concepts.


League 3
Enhance your Python skills and tackle more complex projects through engaging and practical problem-solving exercises.


League 2

League 1
Learn advanced algorithms and data structures. Students are prepared to participate in national and international olympiads including IOI.

Using motion and looks blocks

04
Working with sound and events

05
Creating sequences of actions

06
Using loops for repetition

07
Implementing conditionals for decision-making

08
Handling variables and simple data

09

10
Basic debugging and troubleshooting

League 5
The beginning is a great place to start. This chapter introduces students to the fundamentals of programming using Scratch, a visual programming language. The interactive and visual nature of Scratch helps learners grasp core programming concepts through engaging projects and games. Developing these skills demands serious practice, that’s why we have over 200 practical problems ready to go.


Topics per module
01
Introduction to Python and its Environment

02
Python Syntax and Basic Commands

03
Data Types and Variables in Python

04
Input and Output Operations

05
Conditional statements: if, elif, else

06
Looping structures: for and while loops

07
Simple function definitions

League 4
This chapter bridges the gap between visual programming in Scratch and text-based programming in Python. Students learn Python syntax and basics, comparing it with Scratch to ease the transition. They will replicate simple Scratch projects in Python to solidify their understanding.


Topics per module
01
Functions: Definition and Usage
